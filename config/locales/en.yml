            Block layouts determine where a particular set of blocks appear on the page. Some block layouts
            only support certain types of blocks. Creating a new block layout will have no effect until this
            application's code is updated to support the new layout. Destroying a block layout will prevent
            blocks from displaying. The default layout should never be destroyed.

            Translations provide a way to control and update static values that exist throughout the application.
            If your application supports multiple languages, you can also define the translated value in each language
            with the translations interface.
