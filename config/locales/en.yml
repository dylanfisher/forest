            Block layouts determine where a particular set of blocks appear on the page. Some block layouts
            only support certain types of blocks. Creating a new block layout will have no effect until this
            application's code is updated to support the new layout. Destroying a block layout will prevent
            blocks from displaying. The default layout should never be destroyed.
