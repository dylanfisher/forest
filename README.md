# ðŸŒ² Forest
Forest is a Rails 5 CMS that provides an opinionated starting point when creating new websites.
Much inspiration was drawn from Wordpress' dashboard. The Forest dashboard uses Bootstrap and very little
additional CSS to create an easily customizable interface.

## Features
Forest aims to include the following features out of the box.

### Pages
Pages are versionable, schedulable and draftable. Each page is composed of a series of page blocks that
a user can use to create dynamic page layouts. Additional blocks are easy to develop using regular Ruby
classes and methods. Forest doesn't use any custom DSL.

### Media Browser
An advanced media browser, similar to Wordpress, is included by default and features multi-file drag and drop upload,
and an easy to use modal interface for selecting associated files.

### Menus
An easy to use draggable, nestable interface for managing menus, similar to Wordpress.

### Users
Users and user groups, a permissions system, and secure authentication.

## Usage
Forest runs as an engine. To get started using this gem, create a new rails app and add the forest gem to your gemfile.

Mount forest in your routes.rb file

```
mount Forest::Engine, at: '/'
```

Install Forest's migrations

```
~rails forest:install:migrations~
bin/rails railties:install:migrations
```

For an example of a host app running Forest, view [github.com/dylanfisher/forest_blog](https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest_blog).
