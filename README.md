# ðŸŒ² Forest
Forest is a Rails 5 CMS that provides an opinionated starting point when creating new websites.
Much inspiration was drawn from Wordpress' dashboard. The Forest dashboard uses Bootstrap and very little
additional CSS to create an easily customizable interface.

## Generating a new app
rails new myapp --database=postgresql

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'forest', git: 'https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest.git'
```

Install gems
```bash
$ bundle
```

Run Forest install generator and follow post-install prompts
```bash
$ rails g forest:install
```

## Features
Forest aims to include the following features out of the box.

### Pages
Pages are versionable, schedulable and draftable. Each page is composed of a series of page blocks that
a user can use to create dynamic page layouts. Additional blocks are easy to develop using regular Ruby
classes and methods. Forest doesn't use any custom DSL.

### Media Browser
An advanced media browser, similar to Wordpress, is included by default and features multi-file drag and drop upload,
and an easy to use modal interface for selecting associated files.

### Menus
An easy to use draggable, nestable interface for managing menus, similar to Wordpress.

### Users
Users and user groups, a permissions system, and secure authentication.

## Usage
Forest runs as an engine. To get started using this gem, create a new rails app and add the forest gem to your gemfile.

Mount forest in your routes.rb file

```
mount Forest::Engine, at: '/'
```

Install Forest's migrations

```
bin/rails railties:install:migrations
```

Delete `layouts/application.html.erb` to use Forest's layout.

Update your ApplicationRecord to inherit from `Forest::ApplicationRecord`

```
class ApplicationRecord < Forest::ApplicationRecord
end
```

For an example of a host app running Forest, view [github.com/dylanfisher/forest_blog](https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest_blog).

## Creating additional block types
First, run the block type generator

```
rails generate forest:block TitleAndTextBlock title:string content:text
```

## Primary Dependencies
Forest relies heavily on the following gems, software and frameworks:

- bootstrap
- cocoon
- devise
- has_scope
- jquery
- kaminari
- paperclip
- postgres
- pundit
- redcarpet
- simpleform
