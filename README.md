# ðŸŒ² Forest
Forest is a Rails 5 CMS that provides an opinionated starting point when creating new websites.
Much inspiration was drawn from Wordpress' dashboard. The Forest dashboard uses Bootstrap and very little
additional CSS to create an easily customizable interface.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'forest', git: 'https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest.git'
```

Install gems
```bash
$ bundle
```

Run Forest install generator
```bash
$ rails g forest:install
```

## Features
Forest aims to include the following features out of the box.

### Pages
Pages are versionable, schedulable and draftable. Each page is composed of a series of page blocks that
a user can use to create dynamic page layouts. Additional blocks are easy to develop using regular Ruby
classes and methods. Forest doesn't use any custom DSL.

### Media Browser
An advanced media browser, similar to Wordpress, is included by default and features multi-file drag and drop upload,
and an easy to use modal interface for selecting associated files.

### Menus
An easy to use draggable, nestable interface for managing menus, similar to Wordpress.

### Users
Users and user groups, a permissions system, and secure authentication.

## Usage
Forest runs as an engine. To get started using this gem, create a new rails app and add the forest gem to your gemfile.

Mount forest in your routes.rb file

```
mount Forest::Engine, at: '/'
```

Install Forest's migrations

```
bin/rails railties:install:migrations
```

For an example of a host app running Forest, view [github.com/dylanfisher/forest_blog](https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest_blog).

## Creating additional block types
First, run the block type generator

```
rails generate forest:block TitleAndTextBlock title:string content:text
```

## Primary Dependencies
Forest relies heavily on the following gems, software and frameworks:

- bootstrap
- cocoon
- devise
- has_scope
- jquery
- kaminari
- paperclip
- postgres
- pundit
- redcarpet
- simpleform

## TODO

Big Picture

- [ ] tests
- [ ] is it better to namespace engine?
- [ ] better naming conventions when it comes to blocks, block_record, and block_slots
- [ ] squash migrations once final db structure is settled upon
- [x] remove any gem dependencies not totally necessary?

Admin

- [ ] more robust filter pattern for index views, and ability to select by multiple filters + search,
      and retain these filters when navigating between records
- [ ] add and/or standardize setting @record and @records instance variables in controller to alias appropriate record
- [ ] add select2 with remote ajax selects, automatically infer path to avoid manual setup for each association input
- [ ] reset password and/or change password when editing user profile
- [ ] email confirmations for user related actions
- [ ] remove font-awesome dependency from simplemde markdown editor
- [ ] add migrations to host app without running install:migrations command
- [ ] versioning option for data associated pages, settings, menus, etc.
- [ ] version diff UI like wordpress?
- [ ] intuitive select2 association UI
- [ ] sortable select2 items
- [ ] modal to create associated records directly from association page?
- [ ] bulk actions to delete pages (and other records)
- [ ] duplicate records
- [x] remove bootstrap as frontend dependency (admin navbar is only place this is currently shared)
- [x] purge cache button
- [x] s3 storage for paperclip, assets, heroku support, etc.
- [x] bulk csv import

Generators

- [ ] initial app generator, or at least very clear instructions on setting up a new app
- [ ] add ability to skip block_record creation when creating new scaffold that doesn't need to support blocks
- [x] scaffold generator
- [x] block type generator

Pages

- [ ] page groups / page heirarchy
- [ ] show page hierarchy in select2 selection?
- [ ] page status for scheduled, pending and hidden states
- [ ] better page versioning, page history navigation, restore content blocks with page version
- [ ] 404 page, error pages
- [x] data associated pages that support blocks

Blocks

- [ ] validate block attributes before saving page
- [ ] more performant record saving when parsing block attributes
- [ ] additional default content blocks, mainly image and/or gallery, maybe video and/or oEmbed
- [ ] solution for color picker, date picker, map picker, etc. similar to ACF

Media Gallery

- [ ] fix slug generation to support uploading images/files with the same name
- [ ] better media item upload in media_item#edit
- [ ] store image dimensions and metadata in attachment https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/wiki/Extracting-image-dimensions
- [ ] ability to add new media items through modals (e.g. featured in on pages)
- [ ] ability to upload other file types, not just images (pdf, video, audio)
- [ ] ability to associate multiple media items at once, e.g. for a carousel
- [ ] crop tool and other enhancements
- [ ] configure paperclip to generate optimized images so that google page speed test doesn't complain about the lack of savings.
- [x] add ability to remove media item (e.g. remove feature media item from page)

Menus

- [ ] create pattern for linking to other record types in navigation menus
- [x] ability to remove menu items

Search

- [ ] frontend search design

JavaScript
- [ ] better namespacing of all custom events. e.g. they should be `forest:my-custom-event`

Settings

- [x] better settings UI, ability to set multiple data types, e.g. boolean, or association
