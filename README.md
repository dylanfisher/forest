# ðŸŒ² Forest
Forest is a Rails 5 CMS that makes creating and managing websites easy.
It draws inspiration from Wordpress' dashboard and makes it easy to upload images,
manage menus, create users with permissions, etc.

## Generating a new app
```
rails new myapp --database=postgresql
```

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'forest', git: 'https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest.git'
```

Install gems
```bash
$ bundle
```

Create database and run migrations
```
$ rails db:create
```

Run Forest install generator and follow post-install prompts
```bash
$ rails g forest:install
```

## Usage
Forest runs as an engine. To get started using this gem, create a new rails app and add the forest gem to your gemfile.

Mount forest in your routes.rb file

```
mount Forest::Engine, at: '/'
```

Install Forest's migrations

```bash
bin/rails railties:install:migrations
```

Delete `layouts/application.html.erb` to use Forest's layout.

Update your ApplicationRecord to inherit from `Forest::ApplicationRecord`

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord < Forest::ApplicationRecord
end
```

Add the blocks directory to Rails' autoload paths:

```ruby
# application.rb
config.autoload_paths << "#{config.root}/app/models/blocks"
```

You may want to add the following code to make it easy to monkey patch Forest's classes:

```ruby
# application.rb
config.to_prepare do
  # Load application's model / class decorators
  Dir.glob(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "../app/**/*_decorator*.rb")) do |c|
    Rails.configuration.cache_classes ? require(c) : load(c)
  end
end
```

Configure bootsnap if necessary by adding the following right underneath `require 'bundler/setup'`:

```ruby
# boot.rb
require 'bootsnap/setup'
```

## Features
Forest aims to include the following features out of the box.

### Pages
Pages are versionable (coming soon), schedulable and draftable. Each page is composed of a series of blocks that
a user can use to create dynamic page layouts. Additional blocks are easy to develop using regular Ruby
classes and methods. Forest doesn't use any custom DSL.

### Media Browser
An intuitive media browser, similar to Wordpress, is included by default and features multi-file drag and drop upload,
and an easy to use modal interface for selecting associated files.

### Menus
A draggable, nestable interface for managing menus, similar to Wordpress.

### Users
Users and user groups, a permissions system, and secure authentication using Devise.

## Creating additional block types
First, run the block type generator. Make sure to restart your server when generating new blocks.

```
rails generate forest:block TitleAndTextBlock title:string content:text
```

## Custom SimpleForm inputs

A number of custom SimpleForm inputs and components are baked into Forest: https://github.com/dylanfisher/forest/wiki/SimpleForm-inputs-&-components

## Video associations uploaded as Media Items
```ruby
# in your migration
add_reference :video_blocks, :video, foreign_key: { to_table: :media_items }
```

```ruby
# video_block.rb
belongs_to :video, class_name: 'MediaItem'
```

```erb
<%= f.association :media_item, label: 'Video', remote: { path: admin_media_items_path(videos: true) } %>
```

## Custom error pages
Add this line to application.rb to tell your host app to use the router to handle errors.

`config.exceptions_app = self.routes`

Delete the error pages in /public to avoid collision with the custom error pages.

Forest's router will render the appropriate error template via `ErrorsController`. Override the placeholder views to customize the error page.

To test the errors in development, set the following config to false.

```ruby
# development.rb

config.consider_all_requests_local = false
```

## Search
Forest makes it easy to integrate with Elasticsearch. Just include the `Searchable` concern in any ActiveRecord models that you want to be searchable.

Then, override the SearchIndexManager method below to indicate which models should be indexed.

```ruby
SearchIndexManager.class_eval do
  def self.indexed_models
    [Page, BlogPost]
  end
end
```

Index your documents using the tasks in forest_elasticsearch_tasks.rake. To rebuild the search index, you'd run:

`rake forest:elasticsearch:rebuild`

## Primary Dependencies
Forest relies heavily on the following gems, software and frameworks:

- bootstrap
- cocoon
- devise
- has_scope
- jquery
- kaminari
- paperclip
- postgres
- pundit
- redcarpet
- simpleform

## TODO

Big Picture
- [ ] add a documentation page directly within the forest cms with FAQ and basic overview of how to use the cms.
- [ ] add additional og tags http://ogp.me/
- [ ] add schema.org microdata where appopriate, e.g. for navigation menus, headers, footers
- [ ] is it better to namespace engine?
- [ ] tests

Admin
- [ ] add migrations to host app without running install:migrations command
- [ ] nested forms are cumbersome at laptop size. It should be easier to rearrange nested items.
- [ ] add ability to insert nested form items in between other nested items.
- [ ] do something more useful with the admin#show view
- [ ] more robust filter pattern for index views, and ability to select by multiple filters + search,
      and retain these filters when navigating between records
- [ ] email confirmations for user related actions
- [ ] versioning option for data associated pages, settings, menus, etc.
- [ ] version diff UI like wordpress?
- [ ] modal to create associated records directly from association page?
- [ ] bulk actions to delete pages (and other records)
- [ ] duplicate records
- [ ] add an option to repeater field to allow adjusting number of fields in each repeated set.
- [ ] remove font-awesome dependency from simplemde markdown editor

Generators
- [ ] add ability to skip block_record creation when creating new scaffold that doesn't need to support blocks

Pages
- [ ] proper drafting/publishing permissions for drafted/published pages
- [ ] page groups / page heirarchy
- [ ] show page hierarchy in select2 selection?
- [ ] better page versioning, page history navigation, restore content blocks with page version

Blocks
- [ ] is it possible to add the ability to create blocks within nested forms?
- [ ] minimum and maximum blocks per layout

Media Gallery
- [ ] add ability to specify image format, perhaps with a just-in-time file processing like this example http://www.ryanalynporter.com/2012/06/07/resizing-thumbnails-on-demand-with-paperclip-and-rails/
- [ ] when uploading video via drag and drop, the preview icon doesn't update properly after upload completes
- [ ] add direct to S3 file upload for large files like video, that otherwise look like they timeout on heroku
- [ ] in the fileUpload progress bar, once the files have been uploaded, change the progress bar to indicate that the server is processing the images. Right now it looks like it just hangs on a 100% green bar.
- [ ] use mini_magick or similar, more efficient image editor to process paperclip files
- [ ] better media item upload in media_item#edit
- [ ] crop tool and other enhancements
- [ ] configure paperclip to generate optimized images so that google page speed test doesn't complain about the lack of savings.

Sass
- [ ] potentially speed up sass compilation by following pattern like this? http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/tale-front-end-sanity-beware-sass-import

Settings
- [ ] when updating featured image setting the home page cache didn't seem to get busted. Need to confirm this.
- [ ] when a setting is referenced in production.rb precompiling assets fails
- [ ] add documentation for how settings should be added. Right now they must be initialized from the i18n en:forest:settings yaml file.
